ArgoCD, CI CD Pipeline

ArgoCD, continious delivery gitops tool for kubernetes

Manifests: YAML files defining Kubernetes resources like Deployments,

Nodes are the physical or virtual machines where Kubernetes runs your workloads

Master Node: Runs the control plane components, including the API server, scheduler,
 and core resource controllers. This node manages the worker nodes and the Pods within them.

Application:In the context of Kubernetes and Argo CD, an application refers to a set of definitions that describe an
 applicationâ€™s resources. Argo CD will manage these resources based on manifests stored in a Git repository. 

Worker Nodes: These nodes run the actual applications in containers. Each worker node has a Kubelet,
 which is an agent for managing the node and communicating with the Kubernetes control plane.

-sudo k3d cluster create IoT -p "8888:30080"
 The mapping "8888:30080" allows you to access services running within your Kubernetes cluster (on port 30080)
 via port 8888 on your local machine. For example, if you have a web application running inside your cluster and
 it's set to expose port 30080, you can access it by navigating to http://localhost:8888 on your host machine.
